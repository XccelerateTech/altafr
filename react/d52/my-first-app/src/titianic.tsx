    1 BLACKNESS
    
    Then two faint lights appear, close together... growing brighter. They
    resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-falling toward us like express
    elevators.
    
    One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL FRAME, looking
    like a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectile
    manipulators.
    
    TILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness
    below. Soon they are fireflies, then stars. Then gone.
    
                                         CUT TO:
    
    2 EXT./ INT. MIR ONE / NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP
    
    PUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up to
    its circular viewport to see the occupants.
    
    INSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. ANATOLY
    MIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singing
    softly in Russian.
    
    Next to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late forties, deeply
    tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from
    famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talking
    treasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurer
    and part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he is propped against the CO2
    scrubber, fast asleep and snoring.
    
    On the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-body
    named LEWIS BODINE, sho is also asleep. Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELY
    OPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is the resident Titanic expert.
    
    Anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment.
